# 2D Pixel Perfect Enhanced
This is a regular 2D Pixel Perfect package with small extra options. New features work when the viewport is smaller than the camera's size e.g. when using the Crop Frame option.

The first change allows set background color to different from than default black. It is available when the viewport is smaller than the camera's size.

Another feature gives the possibility to anchor the viewport to the camera's border. Again, this change works only when the viewport is smaller than the camera's size.
